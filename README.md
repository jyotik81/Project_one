# Predicting mental health following employment status

## Selected topic and reasoning
The contents of this repository is an analysis of mental health in people using employment status and mental health indicators. The reasons for leaving their jobs and 
-Reason for leaving jobs between 2002-2012
-Mental health during layoffs 2002-2012
Using the data we've found on the topics above, we will be able to determine and show during our presentation the common factors and reasons why people tend to quit their jobs and how that impacts their mental health. The age and sex varies between people and we will be able to determine a report that will give us details about the consequences and effect is has. 

## Data
The data was collected from Statistics Canada. It includes two datasets:
- Reason for leaving job during previous year, annual (x 1,000)1

- We will be using the data in the link above to clean it and have it ready to use. Once that is done we will be able to work with it to build our both of our tableau and combine them together to see the results. We will be using that by using ERD into the Tableau from where we will have cleaned the dataset.

## Limitations
It is important to mention, that the years selected (2002 and 2012) were due to the fact that only those years are publicly available. We encountered an issue where the most recent data based on our project goes back from 2002 to 2012. These are the most recent and up to date where the age, gender and location are all present to and match both tables.


## Questions that the team plans to answer with the project;
-The reason why employees tend to leave their current work.
-Stats divided by age, sex, type of drugs that leads employees to leave
-We will be able to identify
